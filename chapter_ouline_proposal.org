Since its inception in 1994, Lean Construction has fundamentally revolved around theoretical and practical aspects associated with the new production management theory into the AEC industry. Thus, the perception that Lean Construction was a simple extension of Lean Manufacturing principles in construction has changed as this has been established as a production management theory in its own right incorporating new fields to its body of knowledge such as planning and control, organization, culture and people, supply chain, information technologies, teaching and education, sustainability and safety, design and cost management, procurement and contract management, lean in the public sector. 
This has been the result of transformational changes in Lean Construction research and implementation across the globe over the last 25 years that has concluded in the realization that the most significant triad in today’s business is the one composed of people, processes, and technology, with all that this nexus entails.
In the 70’s, automation changed how different operations from order request and billing to CAD and manufacturing took place increasing dramatically productivity. In the 80’s, the advent of the “Internet” enabled integration levels never seen before across the supply chain (locally and globally). Nowadays, the advent of “fourth industrial revolution” with its associated technologies such cyber physical systems, mixed-reality, internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), mixed-reality, and its impact on the AEC industry, is demanding a rethinking of the role of Lean Construction as a driver of ongoing improvement with reduction of waste and increase of value at its core. In fact, the capability of Lean Construction to effectively adapt to this new era full of digital changes requires a reconceptualization of the triad people-processes-technology within the theoretical and practical framework of Lean Construction. Therefore, a shift towards Lean Construction 4.0 is required.
Lean Construction 4.0 as a new systems-wide thinking where synergies and overlaps between Lean Construction and digital/smart technologies goes far beyond BIM, and how this concept will reshape the way we design, manage, and operate capital projects in the modern age of automation. On reflection, researchers around the world have touched timidly different aspects of Lean Construction and digital/smart technologies. Our aim for this call for contributions from international experts at the interface of Lean Construction and digital/smart technologies is to channel research efforts to generate an edited book on Lean Construction 4.0 and discuss current research and practice, challenges and drivers, and future perspectives of Lean Construction 4.0. We are in discussions with Taylor and Francis about publishing the book, who are excited about this project. Dr Vicente A. Gonzalez (University of Auckland), Assoc. Prof. Farook Hamzeh (University of Alberta), and Prof. Luis Fernando Alarcon (Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile) are pleased to invite become a contributor in one of the chapters of the “Lean Construction 4.0” Book.

**** DONE Theoretical underpinning
     The building construction industry faces challenges, such as increasing project complexity and scope requirements, but shorter deadlines. Additionally, economic uncertainty and rising business competition with a subsequent decrease in profit margins for the industry demands the development of new approaches to construction management. However, the building construction sector relies on practices based on intuition and experience, overlooking the dynamics of its production system. Furthermore, researchers maintain that the construction industry has no history of the application of mathematical approaches to model and manage production. 
Much work has been carried out on how manufacturing practices apply to construction projects, mostly lean principles. Nevertheless, there has been little research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of production in construction. 
This theory examines the existing knowledge about production models in manufacturing and their characteristics to establish a foundation for dynamic production systems management in construction. 
**** DONE Technology
     On a project management dayly basis collect and process information is challenging. Information is inaccurate often provenient from guesses instead of measurement. Process information into knowledge is then discouraged or outcome into to also innacurate results. What may support incorrect decision. In manufacturing, the operation is constantly monitored by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The system monitors, gathers, and processes real-time In manufacturing, the production moves from machine to machine, worker to worker, or a combination of both. The route of production is fixed. Thus, the positions of sensors and actuators are fixed and planned according to the production routes and its flow. Once set, the positions only need to be modified if the production routes change. In construction production routes are flexible. “Jobs arrive in different forms and require different tasks, and thus the equipment tends to be relatively general purpose (Hayes and Wheelwright 1979).” Some production routes will only exist long after the beginning of the project by the time that others would be extinct. Construction must then rely on general purpose sensors that, as the equipment, can be used in different applications through the project life-cycle, often, requiring those also to be mobile. Hence, traditional instrumentation (and sensor positioning) used in a manufacturing SCADA systems do not work in construction, as the instrumentation must be mobile.

     The collected production data feeds the Productivity Function modelling algorithm.
By considering the transient state, Productivity Function produces models that are more accurate in describing the processes dynamics than the steady state approaches. The Productivity Function provides a mathematical foundation to develop algebraic for the calculations of cycle times (average, best- and worst-cases), throughput at capacity, and the influence of the transient state time in the production variability. 
Productivity Function has been applied in feedback loop control yielding a controlling
approach [Productivity Function Predictive Control (PFPC)] that can achieve high performances even when processes operate closer to capacity. Moreover, this performance enhancement is higher when PFPC is applied to processes in a parade- of-trades. The PFPC shown to be a robust approach to plan, control, and optimize production and supply chain in construction with direct implications to management practices such as takt time. A benefit of PFPC is its focus on minimizing the variances of output to the set point or plan. The PFMPC can operate satisfactorily even without an accurate model. In practice, the use of adaptive PFPC (APFPC) can be useful. This adaptive version estimates a Productivity Function cyclically within a period; thus, the control relies on a model that is accurate to the current time frame. Therefore, if the production system evolves (which is the goal of continuous improvement) that makes the model obsolete, APFPC can relearn the process and estimate a new model automatically.

**** DONE People
     The theory, as well as the automated support system, aims to support project managers' decision-making process and project processes execution. 
 The data and the theory  tends to eliminate informal processes 
 as these are continuously monitored and assessed.
 Moreover, the data (from production progress and workers' effort) generate a process history and benchmark for future projects.
 That creates the opportunity for continuous improvement in project-driven production.
 Thus, managers can develop and standardize better processes. 
 Companies will quantitatively assess and qualify the performance of contractors in previous projects. 
 In an intensive third-party contracting industry such as construction, low productivity companies that often make mistakes are costly, and consequently, placed at the end of the supplier’s list or excluded. 
 Construction needs an increase in the number of builders. 
 Most importantly, the industry needs builders with better performance.
     

**** DONE Research methodological approach

***** Stage I: Modeling isolated processes
      The purpose of this stage is to characterize the behavior of isolated repetitive production processes to provide a reliable mathematical framework capable of simulating and predicting the performance of these processes on transient, steady and unsteady state conditions. The case studies consist of sample data of repetitive processes from real building construction projects, obtained from industry or from the literature. These projects include, for instance, offshore oil wells, housing projects, and high-rise building. The operational data describes the process input-output behavior over time, where the input is the primary determinant of the process output.

      This heuristic and broad view allow the Productivity Function to describe a variety of project-driven systems that could be modeled as an input/output system with various input categories such as material, tools, equipment, labor, management, time, and conditions (Blanchard and Fabrycky, 2011). "Some of these factors, such as material, also become a part of the output product, while others are needed for control purposes (e.g., management). Still another category includes environmental impacts (e.g., weather conditions) (Remold, 1989, p.164)." The outputs are (usually) the product of the processes, for example, absolute quantities such as square meters of plastered wall and meters drilled, or relative measurements of progress such as the percentage of activity completion (Antunes et al., 2016). This last may be especially useful for Lean Construction practitioners that utilize the Planned Percent Complete (PPC) as the tracking tool. Then, the input-output data would be organized into variables in a spreadsheet or database, depending on data volume.

      From the subject input-output data, it is possible to estimate mathematical models of dynamic systems using system identification approaches, such as transfer function (Ilvedson, 1998) and state-space (Ogata, 2010, pp.29-42) models. Construction processes are hard to determine from physical First principles and specifications. This research focuses on the fundamentals of production rather than the characteristics of each process specifically. When the inputs and outputs of the system are known, but there is no mathematical description of the process, a black-box approach is useful to estimate dynamic systems models. Black-box modeling is often a trial-and-error process where parameters of various models are estimated and the output from those models are compared to the results with the opportunity for further refinement. The resulting models vary in complexity depending on the flexibility needed to account for both the dynamics and any noise in the data. A simple model structure (first-order-differential equation) is attempted initially before progressing to more complex structures (higher orders of differential equation). The iteration between the system model re?nement and validation happens until the simplest function that properly represents the system dynamics is found. To do so, MATLAB's System Identification Toolbox (Gran, 2007; MathWorks Inc., 2015; Singh and Agnihotri, 2001) was used.

The analysis comprehends the following quality measurement: 100% normalized root mean square (best-fit) (Armstrong and Collopy, 1992; Ljung, 2010). As additional quality indicators: Akaike's Final Prediction Error (Jones, 1975), loss function (Berger, 1985), and mean squared normalized error performance function (Poli and Cirillo, 1993) are also used. For the additional quality measurements, a perfect fit corresponds to zero meaning that the simulated or predicted model output is the same as the measured data. A residual analysis of the best model takes place producing a visual tool to analyze the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the residuals with the input (Singh and Agnihotri, 2001). If the best model fails the residuals analysis, i.e., the whiteness and independence tests, the next best model in the multi-criteria decision tool is used in the residual analysis. The process will be repeated until a valid model is found. 

***** Stage II: Characterizing the connectivity between processes
      In this stage, the interaction between processes was investigated. The production processes were connected to establish a chain that was studied using the models obtained from the previous objective. The models were assembled in such way that the output of a model determines the input of the following model. This network of models established a chain which follows the production workflow of the subject process (Bapat, 2012; Callier and Desoer, 1991; Chen, 1999; Xu et al., 2003). The holistic perspective allowed the creation of a system driven by a primary input while all others variables interacted as subsystems of the main system. On the other hand, the division of a system into subsystems is also explored together with the characteristics that permit this subdivision (Singh and Agnihotri, 2001, pp.57-110), i.e., linear time- invariant system (Mandal, 2006, pp.11-13). The individual analysis of the processes in the chain may be useful to identify problematic processes within the production chain.

***** Stage III: Identifying the fundamental mechanisms of production
      Next, the fundamental mechanisms of production aspects such as process variability, cycle time, throughput, and work-in-process were examined in the process chain (Hopp and Spearman, 2001). Moreover, different points on the network can provide measurements with different meanings. Hence, it is possible to extract the data that describe the aimed variables from the network by using algebraic connections (such as signal summing, subtraction, gain) (Ogata, 2010). Additionally, it is possible to read transient states during simulation by introducing scopes and data displays into the block diagram, representing the process network (Nise, 2010). These measurements are then compared to the theoretical values obtained by production equations developed from the Production Functions.
***** Stage IV: Developing mathematical equations for the fundamental mechanisms of production
      The data obtained from stage three were used to create models that represent cycle time, throughput, work-in-process, and variability using the approach from stage one, i.e., the result of system identification approaches analysis. Additionally, linear regression, statistical or algebraic methods may also be used. MATLAB's Simulink (MathWorks Inc., 2015) was used in stages two to four as an environment for multiple domain simulations and model-based design employing block diagrams. This tool supplies a graphical interface with customizable blocks and solvers suitable for the integration of the models obtained from the previous objective. Furthermore, the data exchange between Simulink and the workspace is a desirable feature in case of further analysis of results is needed. Similarly, simulation of discrete events may be analyzed and optimized, obtaining latency, throughput, and other characteristics that may require quantifizcation. Stability and stabilizability concepts (Zabczyk, 2008, pp.28- 49) were applied to examine the process variability and their effects in the system state conditions. The outcomes are mathematical formulations of the fundamental mechanisms of production in manufacturing that will apply to repetitive processes in construction projects.

***** Stage V: Developing fundamental equations for production and optimization approaches
      The fundamental mechanisms regarding production in manufacturing were explored as were the relationships between cycle time, throughput and work-in-process and their effects on production. Little's Law, Best-Case Performance, Worst-Case Performance and Labor Capacity (Hopp and Spearman, 2001) scenarios were reproduced using the models. Later, the concept of the feedback loop to control the dynamic behavior of the system was investigated. By using a controller, such as proportional- integral-derivative (PID) and model predictive controller (MPC), the operation of the system is subjected to corrective actions (Mandal, 2006; Nise, 2010; Ogata, 2010). The controller alters the manipulated variable using a combination of mathematical operations. The control system con?guration will provide means to manipulate a parameter, for instance, cycle time, throughput and/or work-in-process, to obtain the best outcome of a production system.

**** DONE Discussion on how lean principles are supported by the suggested technology
     This theory stands on the four pillars of manufacturing knowledge and lean production: production processes, production management, equipment/tool design, and automated systems and control.
 The production processes, in this case, project-driven processes, are divided into planning, monitoring, controlling, and executing groups clustering technologies to track both the project product and production.
 The research translates production management theory (e.g., variability and capacity) to project-driven production management.
 As such, to mathematically determine a process model and its features, a novelty approach was developed: the Productivity Function.
 The Productivity Function deals with project-driven production processes as a system structured as input(s) \rightarrow processes \rightarrow output(s). Information collection of input(s) and output(s) is crucial to calculate the process. As such, the project management automated system and control utilizes a series of techniques such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, and internet-of-things (IoT) to collect data.

**** DONE How do we apply this?
     On a project management dayly basis collect and process information is challenging. Information is inaccurate often provenient from guesses instead of measurement. Process information into knowledge is then discouraged or outcome into to also innacurate results. What may support incorrect decision. In manufacturing, the operation is constantly monitored by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The system monitors, gathers, and processes real-time In manufacturing, the production moves from machine to machine, worker to worker, or a combination of both. The route of production is fixed (Antunes and Gonzalez 2015; Hayes and Wheelwright 1979). Thus, the positions of sensors and actuators are fixed and planned according to the production routes and its flow. Once set, the positions only need to be modified if the production routes change. In construction production routes are flexible. “Jobs arrive in different forms and require different tasks, and thus the equipment tends to be relatively general purpose (Hayes and Wheelwright 1979).” Some production routes will only exist long after the beginning of the project by the time that others would be extinct. Construction must then rely on general purpose sensors that, as the equipment, can be used in different applications through the project life-cycle, often, requiring those also to be mobile. Hence, traditional instrumentation (and sensor positioning) used in a manufacturing SCADA systems do not work in construction, as the instrumentation must be mobile.

**** DONE Benefits and impacts
     The contribution to the body of knowledge of this thesis is a new view of production in project-driven processes in construction. This system view is founded on the relation between cause and consequence described by the manipulation of inputs to control the process's output as in a dynamic system. This relation can now be determined with a higher accuracy than can be obtained using traditional steady state methods. By considering the transient state and the steady, or unsteady, state, the Productivity Function may cornerstone on the understanding of the dynamics of production in construction and on the development of a mathematical foundation for the management of project-driven production. For instance, the measurement of transient time supports the application of SMED practices in construction processes, which increase productivity by reducing setup times. On the other hand, being able to calculate the throughout at capacity of processes allow the calculation of productivity loss, benchmarking of processes, and supports the management of these processes. For instance, on ?emergency situations, processes with shorter transients are preferable once they can quickly reach high throughput, for instance, temporary bridges constructed for evacuation. On the other hand, for long runs, processes with high throughput at steady-state may be more desirable as in the case of the use of tunnel boring machines (TBM) which have long setup times but high productivity at steady-state.

     This theory also contributed to the Construction Management body of knowledge by providing a set of analytical equations towards a mathematical production theory for project-driven processes. This mathematical production theory not only points out production parameters in construction processes that were previously unmeasurable, e.g., transient time and capacity but also provide a framework for controlling the processes. The outcome of this study directly applies to the management of supply chain or processes arranged in a chain as a tool for benchmarking, plan- ning, monitoring, and control. It can also be applied to isolated processes but with diminished benefts. For instance, by comparing the cycle times of two processes, a manager can determine that a process with much lower cycle times than a precedent one will have idle resources even when the precedent operates near capacity. Based on this information, managers can allocate resources to balance the productivity of the processes. Moreover, this resource balance and process control can be performed automatically using the Productivity Model Predictive Control. In a chain of processes, the better control allows smaller bufers between the processes. With better control and more predictable performance, the slack between processes can be reduced. Results show that the controlling approaches can achieve high process performances even when operating closer to capacity. Better tracking and control allows the process to operate closer to capacity, consequently, achieving higher productivity. Altogether, it is possible to increase production without increasing resources. That immediately results in cost reduction. In similar fashion, the Productivity Function can be used in dynamics simulation which is based on ordinary diferential mathematical models. Dynamics simulation has a signi?cant role in the supply chain but is rarely applied in construction due to the lack of suitable mathematical models to describe the production in construction. These models can now be generated easily, consequently enabling the application of Dynamics Simulation in production. Understanding Understanding production mechanisms in conjunction with systematic methods will enable the use of means-ends analysis in project-driven production systems. Construction processes could be simulated with higher accuracy and with control approaches closer to the reality of those used by managers. Furthermore, the integration of production mechanisms with means-ends analysis provides a system view supporting the identifcation of production issues via model iteration benefcial to project management especially risk management and decision-making.

**** A Production Model for Construction: A Theoretical Framework
     The building construction industry faces challenges, such as increasing project complexity and scope requirements, but shorter deadlines. Additionally, economic uncertainty and rising business competition with a subsequent decrease in profit margins for the industry demands the development of new approaches to construction management. However, the building construction sector relies on practices based on intuition and experience, overlooking the dynamics of its production system. Furthermore, researchers maintain that the construction industry has no history of the application of mathematical approaches to model and manage production. Much work has been carried out on how manufacturing practices apply to construction projects, mostly lean principles. Nevertheless, there has been little research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of production in construction. This study develops an in-depth literature review to examine the existing knowledge about production models and their characteristics in order to establish a foundation for dynamic production systems management in construction. As a result, a theoretical framework is proposed, which will be instrumental in the future development of mathematical production models aimed at predicting the performance and behaviour of dynamic project-based systems in construction.
**** Identification of repetitive processes at steady- and unsteady-state: Transfer function
     Projects are finite terminating endeavors with distinctive outcomes, usually, occurring under transient conditions. Nevertheless, most estimation, planning, and scheduling approaches overlook the dynamics of project-based systems in construction. These approaches underestimate the influence of process repetitiveness, the variation of learning curves and the conservation of processes' properties. So far, estimation and modeling approaches have enabled a comprehensive understanding of repetitive processes in projects at steady-state. However, there has been little research to understand and develop an integrated and explicit representation of the dynamics of these processes in either transient, steady or unsteady conditions. This study evaluates the transfer function in its capability of simultaneously identifying and representing the production behavior of repetitive processes in different state conditions. The sample data for this research comes from the construction of an offshore oil well and describes the performance of a particular process by considering the inputs necessary to produce the outputs. The result is a concise mathematical model that satisfactorily reproduces the process' behavior. Identifying suitable modeling methods, which accurately represent the dynamic conditions of production in repetitive processes, may provide more robust means to plan and control construction projects based on a mathematically driven production theory.
**** Dynamics of Project-Driven Production Systems in Construction: Productivity Function
     Mathematical models have historically enabled a thorough understanding of production mechanisms in manufacturing supporting actions and laws to improve fabrication and building performance. Although much work has been done to date on modeling of production processes, more studies need to be conducted to understand the dynamics of these processes and develop mathematical relationships and laws that can reliably predict and manage project-driven production systems in construction. The purpose of this research is to explore the hypothesis that production processes in construction can be represented as dynamic systems in which a productivity function describes the time dependence of the systems’ output–input relation. By considering the transient state, productivity function models were more accurate in describing the process dynamics than first-degree polynomials and the arithmetic mean, confirming the hypothesis. The contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is a newmodel that considers different states of project-driven processes.
**** Quicker reaction, lower variability: The effect of transient time in flow variability of project-driven production
     Based on the knowledge of dynamic systems, the shorter the transient response, or the faster a system reaches the steady-state after the introduction of the change, the smaller will be the output variability. In lean manufacturing, the principle of reducing set-up times has the same purpose: reduce the transient time and improve production flow. Analogously, the analysis of the transient response of project-driven systems may provide crucial information about how fast these systems react to a change and how that change affects their production output. Although some studies have investigated flow variability in projects, few have looked at variability from the perspective that the transient state represents the changeovers on project-driven production systems and how the transient state affects the process’ flow variability. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of changes in project-driven production systems from a conceptual point of view, furthermore, measuring and correlating the transient response of five cases to their flow variability. Results showed a proportional relationship between the percentile transient time and flow variability of a process. That means that the quicker the production system reacts to change; the less the distress in the production output, consequently, lower levels of flow variability. As practical implications, lean practices focusing on reducing set-up times (transient time) can have their effects measured on project-driven production flow.
**** Benchmarking Project-Driven Production in Construction Using Productivity Function: Capacity and Cycle Time
     Despite being inaccurate, linear models are often used by construction managers to describe production, which limits the development and application of a production theory. The objective of this study is to formulate and test new equations comprehending the non-steady-state conditions of repetitive project-driven processes in construction to calculate cycle time and capacity based on productivity function models. The algebraic calculations were developed from Little’s Law to estimate cycle times and capacity and then tested on productivity function models of 11 construction processes (two cases arranged in a supply chain). It has been reaffirmed that the transient time negatively impacts process productivity. The transient time and theoretical average cycle time showed a proportional relationship to the average cycle times of the samples, resulting in a benchmarking ranking close to the one measured. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing equations for capacity and cycle time based on a process productivity function model that can be used on processes in any state. It can be an alternative to three-point estimation, for instance.
**** Productivity Function Predictive Control to takt time on project-driven production in construction
     High throughput variability prevents the application of methods that rely on steady cycle times, such as takt time. Lacking an objective control method, production in construction often depends on the manager’s intuition and improvisation. The goal of this study is to verify two automatic control strategies in their ability to increase the throughput of construction processes while keeping a steady throughput. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC), both using Productivity Function models, were applied to a set of isolated and connected processes from a housing project. Results showed that the controlling approaches were successful in achieving higher performances than the original data, even under tougher constraints. Furthermore, the predictive control has shown superior performance than the reactive approach. MPC has shown to be useful in construction due to its proactive characteristic, use of constraints, and performance in a flow. Those, features that support the implementation of takt time.
**** Envision of an Integrated Information System for Project-driven Production in Construction
     Construction frequently appears at the bottom of productivity charts with decreasing indexes of productivity over the years. Lack of innovation and delayed adoption, informal processes or insufficient rigor and consistency in process execution, insufficient knowledge transfer from project to project, weak project monitoring, little cross-functional cooperation, little collaboration with suppliers, conservative company culture, and a shortage of young talent and people development are usual issues. Whereas work has been carried out on information technology and automation in construction their application is isolated without an interconnected information flow. This paper suggests a framework to address production issues on construction by implementing an integrated automatic supervisory control and data acquisition for management and operations. The system is divided into planning, monitoring, controlling, and executing groups clustering technologies to track both the project product and production. This research stands on the four pillars of manufacturing knowledge and lean production (production processes, production management, equipment/tool design, and automated systems and control). The framework offers benefits such as increased information flow, detection and prevention of overburdening equipment or labor (Muri - 無理) and production unevenness (Mura - 斑), reduction of waste (Muda - 無駄), evidential and continuous process standardization and improvement, reuse and abstraction of project information across endeavors.
**** Dynamics of project-driven systems: A production model for repetitive processes in construction
The building construction industry faces challenges, such as increasing project complexity and scope requirements, but shorter deadlines. Additionally, economic uncertainty and rising business competition with a subsequent decrease in profit margins for the industry demands the development of new approaches to construction management. However, the building construction sector relies on practices based on intuition and experience, overlooking the dynamics of its production system. These approaches underestimate the influence of process repetitiveness, the size of the production run, the transient state, the variation of learning curves, and the conservation of processes properties. At this time, construction adopts the manufacturing production model dismissing the application of mathematical approaches that accurately describe the characteristics of its production system. The current theory about fundamental mechanisms of production in repetitive processes in construction is at an embryonic stage and does not yet fully establish the foundations of a production model. The aim of this research is to provide a mathematical model to describe and understand the production mechanisms of repetitive processes in project-driven systems in construction, moreover, applying the model to project management. This study begins with an in-depth literature review to examine the existing knowledge about production models and their characteristics to establish a theoretical framework for controlling dynamic production systems management in construction. On this framework, this research builds an analytical and scalable method (Productivity Function) to represent the behavior of production systems. By considering the transient state, Productivity Function produced models that were more accurate in describing the processes dynamics than the steady state approaches. The Productivity Function provides a mathematical foundation to develop algebraic for the calculations of cycle times (average, best- and worst-cases), throughput at capacity, and the influence of the transient state time in the production variability. Productivity Function is applied in feedback loop control yielding a robust approach to plan, control, and optimize production.
